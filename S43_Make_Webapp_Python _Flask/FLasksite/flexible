Flask Flexibility (Micro-framework)
Minimalistic Design:
Flask provides a lightweight core, giving developers full control over components like routing, templating, and database.

Extensibility:
You can add only what you need via extensions (e.g., Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM), keeping the framework lean and modular.

Custom Project Structure:
No predefined structure; you organize your files and components however you like.

Great for Microservices:
Ideal for small projects or microservices with simple architecture needs.


Django Flexibility (Batteries-included)
Built-in Features:
Includes many ready-to-use components (ORM, authentication, etc.), but you can replace or extend them as needed.

Middleware and Modularity:
Django has customizable middleware and a modular app structure, allowing for reusable apps and scalable architecture.

Scalability:
Designed to scale easily from small apps to enterprise-level projects, making it flexible for complex applications.
Structure with Flexibility: Provides structure with flexibility, allowing custom views, URLs, and template tags while maintaining a standardized workflow.

Flask vs Django (In Summary)
Flask: More freedom and lightweight. Ideal for small apps, custom setups, and microservices.
Django: More structured with flexibility. Ideal for larger, complex applications with built-in tools.
